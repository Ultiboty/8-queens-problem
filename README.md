# 8-queens-problem
this is an assembly x86 project about the 8 queens problem, solving the problem using backtracking depth-first search algorithm.
the program also gives you your own oppurtunity to try and solve the problem.
## Requirements
The app requires you to install the following:
1. dosbox
2. TASM
3. the code and all of the bmps should be stored in the TASM folder. prefferd inside a folder called bin.

## startup
1. open dosbox
2. mount the driver your tasm is on using "mount d: d:\" (same goes for c:) and then "cycles = max"
4. change to driver using "d:" / "c:"
5. change to the path
6. write "tasm /zi codefilename.asm" and after you enter write "tlink /v cofefilename.obj" (note that after doing this step once it can be skiped next times)
7. write "codefilename"
